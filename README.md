# VodafoneZiggo Star Wars Project

This is an assessment that I've made after my application at VodafoneZiggo as a Laravel developer. It's a Laravel project that tests the developer's abilities to create a Laravel project, create a database, store the data inside the database, fetch the data from the database into the VUE components with visualisation.

Instructions on how to run the project:
1. Clone/download the project
2. Run `npm ci`
3. Run `php artisan migrate:refresh`
4. Start the app by running `php artisan serve`
