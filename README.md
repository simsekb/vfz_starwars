# VodafoneZiggo Star Wars Project

This is an assessment that I've made after my application at VodafoneZiggo as a Laravel developer. It's a Laravel project that tests the developer's abilities to create a Laravel project, create a database, store the data inside the database, fetch the data from the database into the VUE components with visualisation.
